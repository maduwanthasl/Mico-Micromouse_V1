## üìù Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a fully functional micromouse named **Mico** from scratch. This involved careful consideration of hardware, custom PCB design, and firmware development. Throughout the process, I selected and evaluated various components to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.

## üîß Hardware Components

Mico is built using carefully chosen components to maximize performance and reliability. Some of the key components include:

- **Microcontroller (MCU)**: STM32 Blue Pill
- **Power Supply**: 3.3V regulator
- **Motor Driver**: [Specify Motor Driver Here]
- **Sensors**: Infrared emitters and receivers for maze sensing
- **Motors**: Precision motors with encoders for accurate movement
- **Additional Components**: Coupling capacitors (100nF, 100V) for noise reduction, etc.

## Component Comparison

## üñ•Ô∏è PCB Design

I designed a custom PCB specifically for Mico to organize and integrate the various components effectively. The PCB design process involved:

- Component selection based on performance requirements.
- Layout and routing in Altium Designer.
- Prototyping and testing to ensure functionality.

The final PCB was successfully manufactured and assembled, forming the core hardware of the micromouse.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Microcontroller - STM32 Blue Pill

Initially, I considered using the STM32 Black Pill due to its higher processing capability. However, due to the limited number of available analog channels, I opted for the **STM32 Blue Pill**, which provided the necessary analog inputs for the sensors. The Blue Pill proved to be reliable and sufficient for Mico‚Äôs control system.

## üìù Firmware Development

The firmware for Mico was developed using **STM32CubeIDE**. Key aspects of the firmware include:

- **Sensor Data Processing**: Collects and processes data from the infrared sensors to detect walls and make navigational decisions.
- **Motor Control**: Controls the speed and direction of the motors for precise movement.
- **Maze Solving Algorithm**: Implements a maze-solving algorithm to navigate and solve mazes autonomously.

The firmware was written in C, leveraging various STM32 libraries for peripheral management and efficient control.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with Mico's firmware and hardware setup:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maduwanthasl/Mico-Micromouse_V1.git
   cd Mico-Micromouse_V1
